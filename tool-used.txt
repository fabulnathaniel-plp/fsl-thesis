Backend Tools
Core Framework:

Flask - Python web framework for serving the application
Flask-SocketIO - Real-time WebSocket communication between frontend and backend

Machine Learning & Computer Vision:

OpenCV (cv2) - Image processing and computer vision operations
MediaPipe - Hand detection and landmark extraction
NumPy - Numerical computations and array operations
scikit-learn - For your existing ML model (assumed to be trained with sklearn)
Pickle - Loading your pre-trained model file

Image Processing:

Pillow (PIL) - Image format conversions and handling
Base64 - Encoding/decoding images for transmission over WebSocket

Server Communication:

python-socketio - WebSocket server implementation
eventlet - Asynchronous networking library for real-time communication

Frontend Tools
Core Web Technologies:

HTML5 - Structure and <video> element for camera access
CSS3 - Styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design
JavaScript (ES6+) - Client-side logic and real-time communication

Browser APIs:

WebRTC API (getUserMedia()) - Accessing user's camera
Canvas API - Drawing hand landmarks and capturing video frames
WebSocket API - Real-time communication with backend

Real-time Communication:

Socket.IO Client - WebSocket client library for bidirectional communication

UI/UX Features:

CSS Grid & Flexbox - Responsive layout
CSS Animations - Smooth transitions and visual feedback
Media Queries - Mobile-responsive design

Communication Protocol
Data Flow:

WebSocket Connection - Persistent connection between browser and server
Base64 Image Encoding - Converting canvas frames to transmittable format
JSON Messages - Structured data exchange for predictions and results

Architecture Pattern
Client-Server with WebSocket Streaming:

Frontend captures camera frames at 10 FPS
Frames are encoded as base64 and sent via WebSocket
Backend processes frames with MediaPipe + your ML model
Results (predictions, confidence, landmarks) sent back in real-time
Frontend displays results and draws hand landmarks overlay

# Web-Based Sign Language Detection App

This is a web-based version of your sign language detection system that runs in the browser with real-time camera feed processing.

## Features

- **Real-time camera access** through web browser
- **Live hand detection** using MediaPipe
- **Sign language recognition** using your trained model
- **WebSocket communication** for real-time processing
- **Visual hand landmarks** overlay on video
- **FPS counter** and confidence metrics
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile and desktop

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Directory Structure

Create the following directory structure:

```
sign-language-web/
├── app.py                 # Backend server
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── model_alphabetc.p     # Your trained model (place here)
└── templates/
    └── index.html        # Frontend interface
```

### 3. Add Your Model

Place your `model_alphabetc.p` file in the root directory next to `app.py`. The app will work in demo mode without the model, but won't make actual predictions.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Access the Application

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Click "Start Camera" to access your webcam
4. Click "Start Detection" to begin sign language recognition
5. Show your hand gestures to the camera

## How It Works

### Backend (Flask + SocketIO)
- **Flask** serves the web interface
- **SocketIO** handles real-time WebSocket communication
- **MediaPipe** processes hand detection on received frames
- **Your ML model** makes sign language predictions
- Results are sent back to the frontend in real-time

### Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)
- **
